### Summarization of Learnings

* Implementing complete browser based game with no server involved
* Using variables and const
* Interactive with DOM
* Selecting HTML elements with different ways
  * `getElementbyId`, `querySelector` along with manual DOM selection with `lastElementChild`, `firstElementChild` etc.
* Adding `eventListeners`
  * addition to `click` also learn about `submit`
  * `event.prevenetDefault()` this makes sure that form is not submitted when clicking a button inside of a form element
  * `FormData` object which we get in form element as a default such as `document`
* conditional `if` checks
* functions , function calling ,for loops (also nested loops)
* choosing a winner with algorithm that checks if the game is completed when 3 same symbols are clicked by one player
